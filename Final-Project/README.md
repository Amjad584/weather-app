in the main folder there are two sub-folders:
    static => where all the [CSS] and [JAVASCRIPT] files are saved.
    templates => where all the [HTML] files are saved.
and then the main [app.py] which run the whole project.


in order to run the project:
requirments:

    #to install them try [pip install (the name of the libary)]

how to run the project:
